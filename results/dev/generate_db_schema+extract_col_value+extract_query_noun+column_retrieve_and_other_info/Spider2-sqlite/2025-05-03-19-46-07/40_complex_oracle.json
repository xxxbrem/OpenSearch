It provides a comprehensive structure for tracking and analyzing business operations, customer information, product details, promotional campaigns, and financial metrics. The database is implemented using SQLite and includes foreign key relationships to ensure data integrity across tables.\n\n# Tables Descriptions:\n\n## Table `countries`:\nContains information about countries, including unique identifiers, ISO codes, names, subregions, regions, and totals. This table is used to categorize and identify countries in relation to customers and other entities.\n\n## Table `customers`:\nStores detailed information about customers, including personal details (e.g., name, gender, marital status), location data (e.g., address, city, state, country), financial data (e.g., income level, credit limit), and other attributes such as phone numbers, email addresses, and validity status. This table is linked to the `countries` table via `country_id`.\n\n## Table `promotions`:\nTracks promotional campaigns, including unique identifiers, names, subcategories, categories, costs, and time periods. This table is used to analyze the effectiveness of promotions and is linked to the `sales` and `costs` tables.\n\n## Table `products`:\nContains information about products, including unique identifiers, names, descriptions, categories, subcategories, pricing, and supplier details. This table is linked to the `sales` and `costs` tables via `prod_id`.\n\n## Table `times`:\nStores time-related data, including dates, day names, calendar and fiscal week/month/quarter/year details, and the number of days in each period. This table is used for time-based analysis and is linked to the `sales` and `costs` tables via `time_id`.\n\n## Table `channels`:\nTracks sales channels, including unique identifiers, descriptions, classes, and totals. This table is used to categorize sales channels and is linked to the `sales` and `costs` tables via `channel_id`.\n\n## Table `sales`:\nRecords sales transactions, including product IDs, customer IDs, time IDs, channel IDs, promotion IDs, quantities sold, and amounts sold. This table serves as the central point for analyzing sales data and is linked to multiple tables (`products`, `customers`, `times`, `channels`, `promotions`).\n\n## Table `costs`:\nTracks cost-related data, including product IDs, time IDs, channel IDs, promotion IDs, unit costs, and unit prices. This table is used to analyze the cost structure of products and is linked to multiple tables (`products`, `times`, `channels`, `promotions`).\n\n## Table `supplementary_demographics`:\nContains additional demographic information about customers, including education, occupation, household size, years of residence, affinity card usage, sports interests, and comments. This table is linked to the `customers` table via `cust_id`.\n\n## Table `currency`:\nStores currency exchange rates for different countries, years, and months, with conversion rates to USD. This table is used for financial analysis and currency conversion.\n\n# Foreign Keys:\n- `customers.country_id` → `countries.country_id`\n- `sales.time_id` → `times.time_id`\n- `sales.channel_id` → `channels.channel_id`\n- `sales.prod_id` → `products.prod_id`\n- `sales.cust_id` → `customers.cust_id`\n- `sales.promo_id` → `promotions.promo_id`\n- `costs.channel_id` → `channels.channel_id`\n- `costs.time_id` → `times.time_id`\n- `costs.prod_id` → `products.prod_id`\n- `costs.promo_id` → `promotions.promo_id`\n",
