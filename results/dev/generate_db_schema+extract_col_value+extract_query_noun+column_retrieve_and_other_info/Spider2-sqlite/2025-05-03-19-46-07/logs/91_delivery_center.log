# Database Description:
The `delivery_center` database is designed to manage and store information related to delivery operations. It includes details about delivery channels, drivers, deliveries, hubs, payments, stores, and orders. The database is structured to track the entire lifecycle of an order, from creation to delivery, while also capturing metrics and operational data for analysis.

# Tables Descriptions:
1. **Channels**:  
   - Contains information about the delivery channels used for orders.  
   - Includes unique identifiers, names, and types of channels.  

2. **Drivers**:  
   - Stores details about drivers involved in the delivery process.  
   - Includes unique identifiers, driver modes (e.g., biker, motoboy), and driver types (e.g., freelance, logistic operator).  

3. **Deliveries**:  
   - Tracks individual deliveries, including their status, distance, and associated driver.  
   - Includes unique delivery IDs, order IDs, and delivery metrics.  

4. **Hubs**:  
   - Represents physical locations (hubs) where deliveries are managed.  
   - Includes unique hub IDs, names, cities, states, and geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude).  

5. **Payments**:  
   - Manages payment information for orders.  
   - Includes unique payment IDs, amounts, fees, methods, and statuses.  

6. **Stores**:  
   - Contains information about stores that generate orders.  
   - Includes unique store IDs, associated hub IDs, names, segments, plan prices, and geographical coordinates.  

7. **Orders**:  
   - Tracks the lifecycle of orders, including creation, delivery, and completion.  
   - Includes unique order IDs, associated store and channel IDs, payment and delivery order IDs, statuses, amounts, delivery fees, timestamps for various stages, and operational metrics.  

# Foreign Keys:
1. **Orders**:  
   - `store_id` → `stores.store_id`  
   - `channel_id` → `channels.channel_id`  
   - `payment_order_id` → `payments.payment_order_id`  
   - `delivery_order_id` → `deliveries.delivery_order_id`  

2. **Deliveries**:  
   - `driver_id` → `drivers.driver_id`  

3. **Stores**:  
   - `hub_id` → `hubs.hub_id`

# Database Description:
The `delivery_center` database is designed to manage and store information related to delivery operations. It includes details about delivery channels, drivers, deliveries, hubs, payments, stores, and orders. The database is structured to track the entire lifecycle of an order, from creation to delivery, while also capturing metrics and operational data for analysis.

# Tables Descriptions:
1. **Channels**:  
   - Contains information about the delivery channels used for orders.  
   - Includes unique identifiers, names, and types of channels.  

2. **Drivers**:  
   - Stores details about drivers involved in the delivery process.  
   - Includes unique identifiers, driver modes (e.g., biker, motoboy), and driver types (e.g., freelance, logistic operator).  

3. **Deliveries**:  
   - Tracks individual deliveries, including their status, distance, and associated driver.  
   - Includes unique delivery IDs, order IDs, and delivery metrics.  

4. **Hubs**:  
   - Represents physical locations (hubs) where deliveries are managed.  
   - Includes unique hub IDs, names, cities, states, and geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude).  

5. **Payments**:  
   - Manages payment information for orders.  
   - Includes unique payment IDs, amounts, fees, methods, and statuses.  

6. **Stores**:  
   - Contains information about stores that generate orders.  
   - Includes unique store IDs, associated hub IDs, names, segments, plan prices, and geographical coordinates.  

7. **Orders**:  
   - Tracks the lifecycle of orders, including creation, delivery, and completion.  
   - Includes unique order IDs, associated store and channel IDs, payment and delivery order IDs, statuses, amounts, delivery fees, timestamps for various stages, and operational metrics.  

# Foreign Keys:
1. **Orders**:  
   - `store_id` → `stores.store_id`  
   - `channel_id` → `channels.channel_id`  
   - `payment_order_id` → `payments.payment_order_id`  
   - `delivery_order_id` → `deliveries.delivery_order_id`  

2. **Deliveries**:  
   - `driver_id` → `drivers.driver_id`  

3. **Stores**:  
   - `hub_id` → `hubs.hub_id`  


Attention:
1. if the question have when\where\which, pay attention to pick table.column related to time, location and name in #columns
2. Please answer the question in the following format without any other content:
```
#reason: Analysis of which columns and values might be relevant to the question. Note that when dealing with questions about time, who, which, what, etc., you should keep column related to time, names, and locations in the #column.(format: The question query xxx, the related column include table.column, the values include values)
#columns: The top 10 columns relevant to the question( format: table.column_1, table.column_2 ...)
#values: Potential filter values that the question might query(format: "value1", "value2" ...)
```
/* Answer the following: In the dataset of orders joined with store information, which store has the highest total number of orders, and among that store’s orders, what is the ratio of orders that appear in the deliveries table with a 'DELIVERED' status to the total orders for that store? */

#reason: The question queries the store with the highest total number of orders and calculates the ratio of 'DELIVERED' orders to total orders for that store. Relevant columns include store details, order counts, and delivery statuses.
#columns: orders.store_id, stores.store_name, orders.order_id, deliveries.delivery_order_id, deliveries.delivery_status
#values: "DELIVERED"
```

现在我们定义一个问句的语法原子单元如下:
Q: 询问词: 如 calculate\ Include\ List\ List out\ List all\ give\ state\ Name\ In which\ How many\  which\ what\ who\ when\ provide\ Tally\ identify\ Find\ mention\ write等
J: 判断词： 如 Do\ Did\ If\ Is\ Are等
I: 查询内容: 查询的主体内容, 如: name, ID, date, location, item, biggest city.
C: 条件句: 通过介词和连词引入的查询的要求或属性, 如大于、等于、排序、聚合等. 介词和连词有: of\ have\ with\ that\ by. 条件句的形式例子有: with condition\ have condition\ of attribute\ that was condition


一个问题通过这些原子串联起来。常见的串联方式有
QIC(询问句): List the student with score more than 80: Q: 'List' I: 'the student' C: 'with score more than 80'
JC(判断句): State if Tom is a Cat? : J: 'State if C: is a Cat?'
C(条件句): For all people in Beijing
现在请你针对下面的问题, 把问题中的内容按照上述原子定义提取出来
问题如下: In the dataset of orders joined with store information, which store has the highest total number of orders, and among that store’s orders, what is the ratio of orders that appear in the deliveries table with a 'DELIVERED' status to the total orders for that store?

请按照下面的json格式进行回答:

```json
[{"Type":"类型(QIC,JC,C)",
"Extract":{//不存在的填null
    "Q":"询问词",
    "J":"判断词",
    "I":['查询内容a', '查询内容b'],//只有查询内容用and或alongside连接时,才分成多个实体填入List
    "C":["条件句a","属性b"]
}},
{}]
