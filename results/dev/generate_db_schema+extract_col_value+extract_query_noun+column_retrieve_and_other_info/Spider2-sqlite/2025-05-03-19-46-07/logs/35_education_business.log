现在我们定义一个问句的语法原子单元如下:
Q: 询问词: 如 calculate\ Include\ List\ List out\ List all\ give\ state\ Name\ In which\ How many\  which\ what\ who\ when\ provide\ Tally\ identify\ Find\ mention\ write等
J: 判断词： 如 Do\ Did\ If\ Is\ Are等
I: 查询内容: 查询的主体内容, 如: name, ID, date, location, item, biggest city.
C: 条件句: 通过介词和连词引入的查询的要求或属性, 如大于、等于、排序、聚合等. 介词和连词有: of\ have\ with\ that\ by. 条件句的形式例子有: with condition\ have condition\ of attribute\ that was condition


一个问题通过这些原子串联起来。常见的串联方式有
QIC(询问句): List the student with score more than 80: Q: 'List' I: 'the student' C: 'with score more than 80'
JC(判断句): State if Tom is a Cat? : J: 'State if C: is a Cat?'
C(条件句): For all people in Beijing
现在请你针对下面的问题, 把问题中的内容按照上述原子定义提取出来
问题如下: Can you provide a list of hardware product segments along with their unique product counts for 2020 in the output, ordered by the highest percentage increase in unique fact sales products from 2020 to 2021?
