Attention:
1. if the question have when\where\which, pay attention to pick table.column related to time, location and name in #columns
2. Please answer the question in the following format without any other content:
```
#reason: Analysis of which columns and values might be relevant to the question. Note that when dealing with questions about time, who, which, what, etc., you should keep column related to time, names, and locations in the #column.(format: The question query xxx, the related column include table.column, the values include values)
#columns: The top 10 columns relevant to the question( format: table.column_1, table.column_2 ...)
#values: Potential filter values that the question might query(format: "value1", "value2" ...)

现在我们定义一个问句的语法原子单元如下:
Q: 询问词: 如 calculate\ Include\ List\ List out\ List all\ give\ state\ Name\ In which\ How many\  which\ what\ who\ when\ provide\ Tally\ identify\ Find\ mention\ write等
J: 判断词： 如 Do\ Did\ If\ Is\ Are等
I: 查询内容: 查询的主体内容, 如: name, ID, date, location, item, biggest city.
C: 条件句: 通过介词和连词引入的查询的要求或属性, 如大于、等于、排序、聚合等. 介词和连词有: of\ have\ with\ that\ by. 条件句的形式例子有: with condition\ have condition\ of attribute\ that was condition


一个问题通过这些原子串联起来。常见的串联方式有
QIC(询问句): List the student with score more than 80: Q: 'List' I: 'the student' C: 'with score more than 80'
JC(判断句): State if Tom is a Cat? : J: 'State if C: is a Cat?'
C(条件句): For all people in Beijing
现在请你针对下面的问题, 把问题中的内容按照上述原子定义提取出来
问题如下: Calculate the duration of each track, classify them as short, medium, or long, output the minimum and maximum time for each kind (in minutes) and the total revenue for each category, group by the category.

请按照下面的json格式进行回答:

```json
[{"Type":"类型(QIC,JC,C)",
"Extract":{//不存在的填null
    "Q":"询问词",
    "J":"判断词",
    "I":['查询内容a', '查询内容b'],//只有查询内容用and或alongside连接时,才分成多个实体填入List
    "C":["条件句a","属性b"]
}},
{}]
```
