现在我们定义一个问句的语法原子单元如下:
Q: 询问词: 如 calculate\ Include\ List\ List out\ List all\ give\ state\ Name\ In which\ How many\  which\ what\ who\ when\ provide\ Tally\ identify\ Find\ mention\ write等
J: 判断词： 如 Do\ Did\ If\ Is\ Are等
I: 查询内容: 查询的主体内容, 如: name, ID, date, location, item, biggest city.
C: 条件句: 通过介词和连词引入的查询的要求或属性, 如大于、等于、排序、聚合等. 介词和连词有: of\ have\ with\ that\ by. 条件句的形式例子有: with condition\ have condition\ of attribute\ that was condition


一个问题通过这些原子串联起来。常见的串联方式有
QIC(询问句): List the student with score more than 80: Q: 'List' I: 'the student' C: 'with score more than 80'
JC(判断句): State if Tom is a Cat? : J: 'State if C: is a Cat?'
C(条件句): For all people in Beijing
现在请你针对下面的问题, 把问题中的内容按照上述原子定义提取出来
问题如下: What is the proportion of legislators who started their first term between 1917 and 1999 that remained in office on December 31st of each year, tracked annually for up to 20 years following their initial term start?

请按照下面的json格式进行回答:

```json
[{"Type":"类型(QIC,JC,C)",
"Extract":{//不存在的填null
    "Q":"询问词",
    "J":"判断词",
    "I":['查询内容a', '查询内容b'],//只有查询内容用and或alongside连接时,才分成多个实体填入List
    "C":["条件句a","属性b"]
}},
{}]
```
