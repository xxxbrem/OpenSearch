#Database Description:
The `California_Traffic_Collision` database is designed to store detailed information about traffic collisions in California. It includes data about victims, collisions, case IDs, and parties involved in the incidents. The database provides insights into various aspects of traffic collisions, such as severity, location, contributing factors, and demographics of the parties involved. This data can be used for analysis, reporting, and improving traffic safety measures.

#Tables Descriptions:
1. **Victims**: Contains information about individuals involved in traffic collisions, including their role, sex, age, degree of injury, seating position, safety equipment used, and whether they were ejected from the vehicle.

2. **Collisions**: Stores detailed information about traffic collisions, including jurisdiction, officer ID, location, weather conditions, road conditions, collision severity, and contributing factors. It also includes data about the number of victims killed or injured, type of collision, and other related attributes.

3. **Case IDs**: Provides a mapping of case IDs to the year of the database entry. This table helps track the year in which the collision data was recorded.

4. **Parties**: Contains information about the parties involved in traffic collisions, including their type (e.g., pedestrian, vehicle), sex, age, sobriety, safety equipment used, and whether they were at fault. It also includes data about violations, injuries, and vehicle details.

#Foreign Keys:
