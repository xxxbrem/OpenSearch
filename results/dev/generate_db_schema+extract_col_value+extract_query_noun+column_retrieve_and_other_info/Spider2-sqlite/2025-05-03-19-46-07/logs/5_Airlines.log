现在我们定义一个问句的语法原子单元如下:
Q: 询问词: 如 calculate\ Include\ List\ List out\ List all\ give\ state\ Name\ In which\ How many\  which\ what\ who\ when\ provide\ Tally\ identify\ Find\ mention\ write等
J: 判断词： 如 Do\ Did\ If\ Is\ Are等
I: 查询内容: 查询的主体内容, 如: name, ID, date, location, item, biggest city.
C: 条件句: 通过介词和连词引入的查询的要求或属性, 如大于、等于、排序、聚合等. 介词和连词有: of\ have\ with\ that\ by. 条件句的形式例子有: with condition\ have condition\ of attribute\ that was condition


一个问题通过这些原子串联起来。常见的串联方式有
QIC(询问句): List the student with score more than 80: Q: 'List' I: 'the student' C: 'with score more than 80'
JC(判断句): State if Tom is a Cat? : J: 'State if C: is a Cat?'
C(条件句): For all people in Beijing
现在请你针对下面的问题, 把问题中的内容按照上述原子定义提取出来
问题如下: What is the distance of the longest route where Abakan is either the departure or destination city (in kilometers)?

请按照下面的json格式进行回答:

```json
[{"Type":"类型(QIC,JC,C)",
"Extract":{//不存在的填null
    "Q":"询问词",
    "J":"判断词",
    "I":['查询内容a', '查询内容b'],//只有查询内容用and或alongside连接时,才分成多个实体填入List
    "C":["条件句a","属性b"]
}},
{}]
```
