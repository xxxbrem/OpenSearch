1. if the question have when\where\which, pay attention to pick table.column related to time, location and name in #columns
2. Please answer the question in the following format without any other content:
```
#reason: Analysis of which columns and values might be relevant to the question. Note that when dealing with questions about time, who, which, what, etc., you should keep column related to time, names, and locations in the #column.(format: The question query xxx, the related column include table.column, the values include values)

/* Answer the following: Calculate the number of new cities inserted in April, May, and June for each year from 2021 to 2023. For each month, compute the cumulative running total of cities added for that specific month across the years up to and including the given year (i.e., sum the counts of that month over the years). Additionally, calculate the year-over-year growth percentages for both the monthly total and the running total for each month, comparing each year to the previous year. Present the results only for 2022 and 2023, listing the year, the month, the total number of cities added in that month, the cumulative running total for that month, and the year-over-year growth percentages for both the monthly total and the running total. Use the data from 2021 solely as a baseline for calculating growth rates, and exclude it from the final output. */

现在我们定义一个问句的语法原子单元如下:
Q: 询问词: 如 calculate\ Include\ List\ List out\ List all\ give\ state\ Name\ In which\ How many\  which\ what\ who\ when\ provide\ Tally\ identify\ Find\ mention\ write等
J: 判断词： 如 Do\ Did\ If\ Is\ Are等
I: 查询内容: 查询的主体内容, 如: name, ID, date, location, item, biggest city.
C: 条件句: 通过介词和连词引入的查询的要求或属性, 如大于、等于、排序、聚合等. 介词和连词有: of\ have\ with\ that\ by. 条件句的形式例子有: with condition\ have condition\ of attribute\ that was condition


一个问题通过这些原子串联起来。常见的串联方式有
QIC(询问句): List the student with score more than 80: Q: 'List' I: 'the student' C: 'with score more than 80'
JC(判断句): State if Tom is a Cat? : J: 'State if C: is a Cat?'
C(条件句): For all people in Beijing
现在请你针对下面的问题, 把问题中的内容按照上述原子定义提取出来
