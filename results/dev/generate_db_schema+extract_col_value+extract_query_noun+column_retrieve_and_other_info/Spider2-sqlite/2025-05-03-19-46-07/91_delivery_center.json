It includes details about delivery channels, drivers, deliveries, hubs, payments, stores, and orders. The database is structured to track the entire lifecycle of an order, from creation to delivery, while also capturing metrics and operational data for analysis.\n\n# Tables Descriptions:\n1. **Channels**:  \n   - Contains information about the delivery channels used for orders.  \n   - Includes unique identifiers, names, and types of channels.  \n\n2. **Drivers**:  \n   - Stores details about drivers involved in the delivery process.  \n   - Includes unique identifiers, driver modes (e.g., biker, motoboy), and driver types (e.g., freelance, logistic operator).  \n\n3. **Deliveries**:  \n   - Tracks individual deliveries, including their status, distance, and associated driver.  \n   - Includes unique delivery IDs, order IDs, and delivery metrics.  \n\n4. **Hubs**:  \n   - Represents physical locations (hubs) where deliveries are managed.  \n   - Includes unique hub IDs, names, cities, states, and geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude).  \n\n5. **Payments**:  \n   - Manages payment information for orders.  \n   - Includes unique payment IDs, amounts, fees, methods, and statuses.  \n\n6. **Stores**:  \n   - Contains information about stores that generate orders.  \n   - Includes unique store IDs, associated hub IDs, names, segments, plan prices, and geographical coordinates.  \n\n7. **Orders**:  \n   - Tracks the lifecycle of orders, including creation, delivery, and completion.  \n   - Includes unique order IDs, associated store and channel IDs, payment and delivery order IDs, statuses, amounts, delivery fees, timestamps for various stages, and operational metrics.  \n\n# Foreign Keys:\n1. **Orders**:  \n   - `store_id` → `stores.store_id`  \n   - `channel_id` → `channels.channel_id`  \n   - `payment_order_id` → `payments.payment_order_id`  \n   - `delivery_order_id` → `deliveries.delivery_order_id`  \n\n2. **Deliveries**:  \n   - `driver_id` → `drivers.driver_id`  \n\n3. **Stores**:  \n   - `hub_id` → `hubs.hub_id`  \n",
