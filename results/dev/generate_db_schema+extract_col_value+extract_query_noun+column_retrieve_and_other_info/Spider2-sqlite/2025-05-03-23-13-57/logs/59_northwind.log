现在我们定义一个问句的语法原子单元如下:
Q: 询问词: 如 calculate\ Include\ List\ List out\ List all\ give\ state\ Name\ In which\ How many\  which\ what\ who\ when\ provide\ Tally\ identify\ Find\ mention\ write等
J: 判断词： 如 Do\ Did\ If\ Is\ Are等
I: 查询内容: 查询的主体内容, 如: name, ID, date, location, item, biggest city.
C: 条件句: 通过介词和连词引入的查询的要求或属性, 如大于、等于、排序、聚合等. 介词和连词有: of\ have\ with\ that\ by. 条件句的形式例子有: with condition\ have condition\ of attribute\ that was condition


一个问题通过这些原子串联起来。常见的串联方式有
QIC(询问句): List the student with score more than 80: Q: 'List' I: 'the student' C: 'with score more than 80'
JC(判断句): State if Tom is a Cat? : J: 'State if C: is a Cat?'
C(条件句): For all people in Beijing
现在请你针对下面的问题, 把问题中的内容按照上述原子定义提取出来
