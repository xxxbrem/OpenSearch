The final set of ingredients should be determined by taking the standard toppings from the pizza’s recipe, removing any toppings specified as exclusions, then adding any toppings specified as extras. The resulting ingredients must be presented in alphabetical order, prefixed by ‘2x’ if the same ingredient appears multiple times (for example, if both standard and extra or added multiple times), and concatenated into a string that begins with the pizza name followed by ‘: ’. Group by row ID, order ID, pizza name, and order time so that each order appears once, and return the listing of toppings in ascending order by row ID, ensuring that ‘Meatlovers’ pizzas receive a pizza_id of 1 while all others receive a pizza_id of 2.",
