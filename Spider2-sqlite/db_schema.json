It includes data about victims, collisions, case IDs, and parties involved in the incidents. The database provides insights into various aspects of traffic collisions, such as severity, location, contributing factors, and demographics of the parties involved. This data can be used for analysis, reporting, and improving traffic safety measures.\n\n#Tables Descriptions:\n1. **Victims**: Contains information about individuals involved in traffic collisions, including their role, sex, age, degree of injury, seating position, safety equipment used, and whether they were ejected from the vehicle.\n\n2. **Collisions**: Stores detailed information about traffic collisions, including jurisdiction, officer ID, location, weather conditions, road conditions, collision severity, and contributing factors. It also includes data about the number of victims killed or injured, type of collision, and other related attributes.\n\n3. **Case IDs**: Provides a mapping of case IDs to the year of the database entry. This table helps track the year in which the collision data was recorded.\n\n4. **Parties**: Contains information about the parties involved in traffic collisions, including their type (e.g., pedestrian, vehicle), sex, age, sobriety, safety equipment used, and whether they were at fault. It also includes data about violations, injuries, and vehicle details.\n\n#Foreign Keys:\n- `victims.case_id` → `collisions.case_id`\n- `parties.case_id` → `collisions.case_id`\n- `parties.party_number` → `victims.party_number`\n",

It provides a comprehensive structure for tracking and analyzing business operations, customer information, product details, promotional campaigns, and financial metrics. The database is implemented using SQLite and includes foreign key relationships to ensure data integrity across tables.\n\n# Tables Descriptions:\n\n## Table `countries`:\nContains information about countries, including unique identifiers, ISO codes, names, subregions, regions, and totals. This table is used to categorize and identify countries in relation to customers and other entities.\n\n## Table `customers`:\nStores detailed information about customers, including personal details (e.g., name, gender, marital status), location data (e.g., address, city, state, country), financial data (e.g., income level, credit limit), and other attributes such as phone numbers, email addresses, and validity status. This table is linked to the `countries` table via `country_id`.\n\n## Table `promotions`:\nTracks promotional campaigns, including unique identifiers, names, subcategories, categories, costs, and time periods. This table is used to analyze the effectiveness of promotions and is linked to the `sales` and `costs` tables.\n\n## Table `products`:\nContains information about products, including unique identifiers, names, descriptions, categories, subcategories, pricing, and supplier details. This table is linked to the `sales` and `costs` tables via `prod_id`.\n\n## Table `times`:\nStores time-related data, including dates, day names, calendar and fiscal week/month/quarter/year details, and the number of days in each period. This table is used for time-based analysis and is linked to the `sales` and `costs` tables via `time_id`.\n\n## Table `channels`:\nTracks sales channels, including unique identifiers, descriptions, classes, and totals. This table is used to categorize sales channels and is linked to the `sales` and `costs` tables via `channel_id`.\n\n## Table `sales`:\nRecords sales transactions, including product IDs, customer IDs, time IDs, channel IDs, promotion IDs, quantities sold, and amounts sold. This table serves as the central point for analyzing sales data and is linked to multiple tables (`products`, `customers`, `times`, `channels`, `promotions`).\n\n## Table `costs`:\nTracks cost-related data, including product IDs, time IDs, channel IDs, promotion IDs, unit costs, and unit prices. This table is used to analyze the cost structure of products and is linked to multiple tables (`products`, `times`, `channels`, `promotions`).\n\n## Table `supplementary_demographics`:\nContains additional demographic information about customers, including education, occupation, household size, years of residence, affinity card usage, sports interests, and comments. This table is linked to the `customers` table via `cust_id`.\n\n## Table `currency`:\nStores currency exchange rates for different countries, years, and months, with conversion rates to USD. This table is used for financial analysis and currency conversion.\n\n# Foreign Keys:\n- `customers.country_id` → `countries.country_id`\n- `sales.time_id` → `times.time_id`\n- `sales.channel_id` → `channels.channel_id`\n- `sales.prod_id` → `products.prod_id`\n- `sales.cust_id` → `customers.cust_id`\n- `sales.promo_id` → `promotions.promo_id`\n- `costs.channel_id` → `channels.channel_id`\n- `costs.time_id` → `times.time_id`\n- `costs.prod_id` → `products.prod_id`\n- `costs.promo_id` → `promotions.promo_id`\n",

It includes details about delivery channels, drivers, deliveries, hubs, payments, stores, and orders. The database is structured to track the entire lifecycle of an order, from creation to delivery, while also capturing metrics and operational data for analysis.\n\n# Tables Descriptions:\n1. **Channels**:  \n   - Contains information about the delivery channels used for orders.  \n   - Includes unique identifiers, names, and types of channels.  \n\n2. **Drivers**:  \n   - Stores details about drivers involved in the delivery process.  \n   - Includes unique identifiers, driver modes (e.g., biker, motoboy), and driver types (e.g., freelance, logistic operator).  \n\n3. **Deliveries**:  \n   - Tracks individual deliveries, including their status, distance, and associated driver.  \n   - Includes unique delivery IDs, order IDs, and delivery metrics.  \n\n4. **Hubs**:  \n   - Represents physical locations (hubs) where deliveries are managed.  \n   - Includes unique hub IDs, names, cities, states, and geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude).  \n\n5. **Payments**:  \n   - Manages payment information for orders.  \n   - Includes unique payment IDs, amounts, fees, methods, and statuses.  \n\n6. **Stores**:  \n   - Contains information about stores that generate orders.  \n   - Includes unique store IDs, associated hub IDs, names, segments, plan prices, and geographical coordinates.  \n\n7. **Orders**:  \n   - Tracks the lifecycle of orders, including creation, delivery, and completion.  \n   - Includes unique order IDs, associated store and channel IDs, payment and delivery order IDs, statuses, amounts, delivery fees, timestamps for various stages, and operational metrics.  \n\n# Foreign Keys:\n1. **Orders**:  \n   - `store_id` → `stores.store_id`  \n   - `channel_id` → `channels.channel_id`  \n   - `payment_order_id` → `payments.payment_order_id`  \n   - `delivery_order_id` → `deliveries.delivery_order_id`  \n\n2. **Deliveries**:  \n   - `driver_id` → `drivers.driver_id`  \n\n3. **Stores**:  \n   - `hub_id` → `hubs.hub_id`  \n",
